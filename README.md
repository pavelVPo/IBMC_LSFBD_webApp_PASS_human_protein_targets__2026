Here is the code for the PASS Human Protein Targets, which is a freely available web version of the PASS Targets [1] based on the PASS software [2] and ChEMBL data [3].

PASS Targets is being developed in the framework of the Russian Academy of Science Basic Research program for 2020-2030; the procedure to create training sets is being developed with the support from RSF.
Current version of the procedure mainly use R language [4] and Tidyverse libraries [5] to process the data.

RDKit.JS [6] is used to process the users's input in the PASS Human Protein Targets (https://way2drug.com/passtargets/).
